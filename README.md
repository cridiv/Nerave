# 📅 DAY 1 — March 23rd: Foundation
> Goal: Every layer has its skeleton running. Nothing pretty, everything connected.

&nbsp;

## 🔷 Joshua — Smart Contracts + Blockchain Module

### Morning (9am – 1pm): Smart Contract
- [x] `forge init paylock-contracts` — scaffold Foundry project
- [x] Write `PayLockAgreement.sol` — core contract with:
  - Agreement struct (client, contractor, total amount)
  - Milestone struct (title, amount, `clientConfirmed`, `contractorConfirmed`, `disbursed`)
  - `confirmMilestone(uint milestoneId)` — callable by client or contractor
  - `MilestoneApproved(uint milestoneId, uint amount)` event — fires when both confirm
- [ ] Write `PayLockAgreement.t.sol` — basic Foundry tests
- [ ] Run `forge test` — all tests passing

### Afternoon (2pm – 7pm): NestJS Blockchain Module
- [ ] Scaffold NestJS project — `nest new nerave-api`
- [ ] Create `blockchain/` module
- [ ] Integrate Viem — set up public + wallet client pointing at Sepolia
- [ ] Write `deployAgreement()` service method — deploys a new contract instance per agreement using ABI + bytecode from `forge build`
- [ ] Write `listenToEvents()` service method — listens for `MilestoneApproved` event on a contract address
- [ ] Test deployment script manually with `cast` — confirm contract appears on Sepolia Etherscan

### End of Day Checkpoint ✅
- Smart contract deploys cleanly on Sepolia
- NestJS can deploy a contract and read its events

&nbsp;

## 🔶 Backend Dev — Project Scaffold + Auth + Schema

### Morning (9am – 1pm): Setup
- [ ] Scaffold NestJS project (coordinate with Joshua — one shared repo)
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL on Supabase free tier
- [ ] Configure Prisma — `prisma init`
- [ ] Write full schema:
  ```
  User (id, email, businessName, apiKey, role)
  Agreement (id, contractAddress, clientId, contractorId, totalAmount, status)
  Milestone (id, agreementId, title, amount, clientConfirmed, contractorConfirmed, disbursed)
  Transaction (id, agreementId, milestoneId, interswitchRef, type, status)
  ```
- [ ] Run `prisma migrate dev` — tables created

### Afternoon (2pm – 7pm): Auth + API Keys
- [ ] Build `auth/` module — email + password registration/login
- [ ] JWT strategy — protect all routes
- [ ] API key generation — every registered business gets a `pk_test_xxx` key
- [ ] API key guard — SDK calls authenticate via this key
- [ ] Test all auth endpoints with Postman

### End of Day Checkpoint ✅
- Database is live on Supabase
- Auth endpoints working
- API key guard protecting routes

&nbsp;

## 🎨 Designer — Brand + Design System

### Morning (9am – 1pm): Brand Identity
- [ ] Define Nerave brand — name means **nerve center of trust**
- [ ] Choose color palette — suggest deep navy `#0A0F1E` + electric teal `#00D4AA` + white
- [ ] Choose typography — one strong display font + one clean body font (avoid Inter/Roboto)
- [ ] Design logo — wordmark or icon mark
- [ ] Create brand board in Figma — colors, fonts, spacing scale, button styles

### Afternoon (2pm – 7pm): Core Screens (Figma)
- [ ] Design landing page — hero, how it works (3 steps), SDK code snippet section, CTA
- [ ] Design dashboard layout — sidebar navigation, main content area
- [ ] Design agreement creation flow — step 1 (details) → step 2 (milestones) → step 3 (payment)
- [ ] Design milestone card component — shows status, confirmation buttons, progress

### End of Day Checkpoint ✅
- Brand board complete
- 4 core screens designed in Figma
- Ready to hand off to frontend implementation tomorrow

---

&nbsp;

# 📅 DAY 2 — March 24th: Core Features
> Goal: The full agreement lifecycle works end to end. Create → Pay → Approve → Disburse.

&nbsp;

## 🔷 Joshua — Contract Events + SDK Package

### Morning (9am – 1pm): Event Listener Integration
- [ ] Wire `listenToEvents()` into the `agreements/` module
- [ ] When `MilestoneApproved` fires → call `payments/` service to trigger Interswitch disbursement
- [ ] Handle event listener lifecycle — start listening when agreement is created, clean up when complete
- [ ] Write contract interaction methods:
  - `confirmMilestone(contractAddress, milestoneId, signerRole)`
  - `getAgreementState(contractAddress)` — read all milestone states

### Afternoon (2pm – 7pm): SDK Package
- [ ] `mkdir nerave-sdk && npm init`
- [ ] Set up TypeScript — `tsconfig.json` with `declaration: true` and `outDir: dist`
- [ ] Write SDK wrapper in TypeScript:
  ```typescript
  new Nerave({ apiKey: 'pk_test_xxx' })
  nerave.agreements.create({ ... })
  nerave.milestones.confirm({ ... })
  nerave.agreements.getStatus({ ... })
  ```
- [ ] Add `baseUrl` config option — defaults to production API, overridable for local dev
- [ ] Export proper TypeScript types for all inputs and responses
- [ ] Point SDK at local NestJS API for now
- [ ] Write `README.md` for the SDK — judges will read this
- [ ] Test SDK methods manually

### End of Day Checkpoint ✅
- Milestone approval on-chain triggers disbursement automatically
- SDK package installable and working locally
- TypeScript types exported cleanly — ready for npm publish on Day 3

&nbsp;

## 🔶 Backend Dev — Agreements + Payments + Webhooks

### Morning (9am – 1pm): Agreements Module
- [ ] `POST /agreements` — creates agreement, tells blockchain module to deploy contract, saves `contractAddress` to DB
- [ ] `GET /agreements/:id` — returns agreement + milestone states
- [ ] `POST /agreements/:id/milestones/:milestoneId/confirm` — records confirmation in DB + calls contract
- [ ] Validate that only the correct party (client or contractor) can confirm each milestone

### Afternoon (2pm – 7pm): Payments + Webhooks
**⚠️ Interswitch has TWO auth systems — know which endpoint uses which before writing any code.**

- [ ] Build `interswitchOAuth()` helper — OAuth 2.0 for payment collection + disbursement:
  ```
  POST https://sandbox.interswitchng.com/passport/oauth/token
  Header: Authorization: Basic Base64(CLIENT_ID:SECRET_KEY)
  Body: grant_type=client_credentials
  → returns access_token (valid for expires_in seconds, cache and reuse it)
  ```
- [ ] Build `interswitchLegacyAuth()` helper — legacy Interswitch Auth for account validation:
  ```
  Headers required: InterswitchAuth, Signature (SHA1), Timestamp, Nonce, SignatureMethod, TerminalID
  Signature = base64(sha1("GET&{url}&{timestamp}&{nonce}&{CLIENT_ID}&{SECRET_KEY}"))
  ```
- [ ] `payments/` module — Interswitch Web Checkout collection (uses OAuth):
  - `initiatePayment(agreementId)` → generates payment URL, redirects client to Interswitch-hosted page
  - `verifyPayment(transactionRef)` → confirms payment status via transaction query
- [ ] `POST /webhooks/interswitch` — receives `TRANSACTION.COMPLETED` event:
  - Verify `X-Interswitch-Signature` using HmacSHA512 against raw JSON body
  - Return HTTP 200 **immediately** before any other processing (Interswitch retries 5x if no 200)
  - Then async: mark agreement as `FUNDED` in DB
- [ ] `disbursement/` service — 4-step flow triggered when `MilestoneApproved` fires:
  ```
  Step 1: Validate contractor account (legacy auth)
  GET /api/v1/nameenquiry/banks/accounts/names
  Headers: InterswitchAuth, Signature, TerminalID, bankCode, accountId

  Step 2: Compute MAC (SHA512) before every transfer:
  mac = sha512(initiatingAmount + initiatingCurrencyCode + initiatingPaymentMethodCode
             + terminatingAmount + terminatingCurrencyCode + terminatingPaymentMethodCode
             + terminatingCountryCode)

  Step 3: Execute disbursement (OAuth Bearer token)
  POST https://qa.interswitchng.com/quicktellerservice/api/v5/transactions/TransferFunds
  Body: { transferCode, mac, initiation: {...}, termination: {...}, sender: {...}, beneficiary: {...} }

  Step 4: Store TransactionReference from response → query status if needed
  ```

### End of Day Checkpoint ✅
- Full flow working: create agreement → pay → confirm milestones → auto-disburse
- Both Interswitch auth helpers working (OAuth + Legacy)
- Webhook verified with HmacSHA512 and returning 200 immediately
- MAC hash computed correctly before every disbursement

&nbsp;

## 🎨 Designer — Frontend Implementation (Next.js)

### Morning (9am – 1pm): Project Setup + Landing Page
- [ ] `npx create-next-app nerave-frontend` — scaffold with Tailwind
- [ ] Set up design tokens in `tailwind.config.js` — brand colors, fonts
- [ ] Build landing page from Figma designs:
  - Hero section with tagline
  - "How it works" — 3 step visual flow
  - SDK code snippet block (syntax highlighted)
  - CTA buttons

### Afternoon (2pm – 7pm): Dashboard + Agreement Flow
- [ ] Build dashboard layout — sidebar + main content
- [ ] Build agreement creation form — multi-step (details → milestones → payment)
- [ ] Build milestone card component — status indicators, confirm button
- [ ] Connect to backend API — agreement creation + payment initiation
- [ ] Basic auth pages — login + register

### End of Day Checkpoint ✅
- Landing page live on Vercel
- Dashboard functional with real API calls
- Agreement creation flow working end to end in UI
